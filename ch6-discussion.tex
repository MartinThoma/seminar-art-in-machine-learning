What does these examples mean for our understanding of creativity? Does it
influence how much we value art? Could we define art and creativity better
after having those and similar results?

I think we might readjust our understanding of creativity just like we adjusted
our understanding of algorithmically hard problems after Deep Blue won against
the reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov in~1997.

However, by now it is obvious that machine learning algorithms cannot compete
with human artists. Today's state of the art algorithms which are purely based
on machine learning don't follow a central theme. They lack the ability to
plan. Although clever algorithms were implemented for composing music, it seems
as if there is still a lot of supervision involved.
