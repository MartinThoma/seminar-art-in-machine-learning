What does these examples mean for our understanding of creativity? How does it
influence how much we value art? Could we define art and creativity better
after having those and similar results?

I think we might readjust our understanding of creativity just like we adjusted
our understanding of algorithmically hard problems after Deep Blue won against
the reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov in~1997.
