## Not included

* [Magic The Gathering card creation](http://nerdist.com/what-happens-when-artificial-intelligence-makes-magic-the-gathering-cards/):
  I did not get an answer which technique was actually used. It might as well
  just be somebody who made them himself and claimed it is machine learning.
* Image captioning, especially http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2306, should really
  be in the image part. However, there was too little time for it and the
  ideas are too complex for this course.
* Latent image space due to a lack of time and as it is too complicated.
