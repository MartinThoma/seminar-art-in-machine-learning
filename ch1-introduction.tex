\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
When people talk about creativity, it is usually said to be in some sense the
opposite of an engineering approach: It isn't planned, not repeatable. However,
recent advances in machine learning produce results which the author would
intuitively call \enquote{art} and thus also \enquote{creative}.

This paper gives a high-level overview over several creative results obtained
by analyzing or applying machine learning techniques.

This paper is structured as follows: \Cref{sec:introduction} introduces the
reader on a very simple and superficial level to machine learning,
\cref{sec:images} gives examples of art with images, \cref{sec:music} gives
examples of machine learning and music. A discussion follows in
\cref{sec:discussion}.
