\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
According to \cite{LongmanDCE06} \textit{creativity} is \enquote{the ability to
use your imagination to produce new ideas, make things etc.} and
\textit{imagination} is \enquote{the ability to form pictures or ideas in your
mind}.

Recent advances in machine learning produce results which the author would
intuitively call creative. A high-level overview over several of those
algorithms are described in the following.

This paper is structured as follows: \Cref{sec:ml-basics} introduces the
reader on a very simple and superficial level to machine learning,
\cref{sec:images} gives examples of art with images, \cref{sec:text-generation}
gives examples of machines producing textual content, and \cref{sec:music}
gives examples of machine learning and music. A discussion follows in
\cref{sec:discussion}.
