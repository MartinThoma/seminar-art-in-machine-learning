\begin{abstract}
Recent machine learning techniques can be modified to produce results which
look interesting. Those results did not exist before; it is not a trivial
combination of the data which was fed into the machine learning system. The
obtained results come in multiple forms: As images, as text and as audio.

This paper gives a high level overview of how they are created and gives some
examples. It is ment to be a summary of the current work.
