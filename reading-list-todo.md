AARON, Experiments in Musical Intelligence, Generative Electronica Research Project, The Painting Fool, +Patrick Tresset's Robots, oh and Sims'  Galápagos  ... off the top of my head.

Note: as far as I know these are actually art/music oriented, whereas your examples above (as far as I understand) are only not. If you just want to talk about images, then that's fine, but if you want to talk about machines making art you should show examples of machines explicitly making art/music, not just images/sound.

I suggest you look at the proceedings for the International Conference on Computational Creativity and the International Symposium on Electronic Art, the Leonardo Journal, and finally the books Metacreation (Whitelaw) and Information Arts (Wilson). Again off the top of my head, so I could have missed something.﻿
