  Review                   = {Authors use Recurrent Neural Networks (LTSMs to be exact) together with GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) to build a network which can be trained to generate music.
Instead of taking notes / MIDI files, they took raw audio waveforms as input. Those audio waveforms are feature vectors given for time steps $0, 1, \dots, t-1, t$.
The network is given those feature vectors $X_1, \dots, X_t$ and has to predict the following feature vector $X_{t+1}$. This means it continues the music.
As the input is continous, the problem was modeled as a regression task.
Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) was used on chunks of length N of the music to obtain features in the domain of the frequency.},
