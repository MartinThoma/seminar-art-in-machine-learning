  Abstract                 = {In k-means clustering, we are given a set of n data points in d-dimensional space Rd and an integer k and the problem is to determine a set of k points in Rd, called centers, so as to minimize the mean squared distance from each data point to its nearest center. A popular heuristic for k-means clustering is Lloyd's (1982) algorithm. We present a simple and efficient implementation of Lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm, which we call the filtering algorithm. This algorithm is easy to implement, requiring a kd-tree as the only major data structure. We establish the practical efficiency of the filtering algorithm in two ways. First, we present a data-sensitive analysis of the algorithm's running time, which shows that the algorithm runs faster as the separation between clusters increases. Second, we present a number of empirical studies both on synthetically generated data and on real data sets from applications in color quantization, data compression, and image segmentation},

Instead of taking notes / MIDI files, they took raw audio waveforms as input. Those audio waveforms are feature vectors given for time steps $0, 1, \dots, t-1, t$.
The network is given those feature vectors $X_1, \dots, X_t$ and has to predict the following feature vector $X_{t+1}$. This means it continues the music.
As the input is continous, the problem was modeled as a regression task.
Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) was used on chunks of length N of the music to obtain features in the domain of the frequency.},
